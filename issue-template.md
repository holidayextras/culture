The following is a template for issues raised in Github repos.

The first three questions should always be answered, the remaining are subject to requirement.
Be as specific as possible and provide links to other discussions/issues/PRs etc where possible.

If you are creating an tech debt with your work then create issues to be resolved for this and list them in the appropriate section.

If you know the work will be undertaken by a specific POD then add a label with the POD name to the issue.

If you are creating multiple issues around a topic or with a common goal then create a milestone and add all relevant issues to it.

```
#What is the problem you're trying to solve?

#What is the benefit in solving it?

#What is the expected result of this issue?

#What unknowns are there to deal with?

#What other work does this rely on?
- [link to issue]()

#What tech debt will this create?
- [link to new issue to cover tech debt])
```
