# Mob Testing


The Mob Testing Method can be used with any amount of testers and wouldnâ€™t always require a large group. As long as
those involved are working on the same piece of work and are collectively raising any issues/advisories together. 

Mob Testing is most useful when a large or new piece of code is going to be deployed to production and could
potentially have a big impact. It is most effective when there is a group of 2 or more all looking at the same work
and sharing Browsers and Devices between them. It is a quicker process in finding bugs and more of an exploratory
approach is taken. 

There is no limit to the amount of people that can be involved in Mob Testing providing the session is arranged
beforehand. An example would be if you had 10 or more members involved you could split off into smaller groups or
alternatively stay as one group and rotate between one person driving the mac and one person influencing what to
test/check.

Mob Testing is most definitely not an excuse to leave all testing on a piece of code to the last minute. We should
still be testing promptly and often to ensure we catch any issues early on.  

If you need to arrange a Mob Testing session please consider the above points beforehand.

## Key features of Mob Testing:

* Only requires a minimum of 2 people 
* Useful for when large pieces of code are being deployed to production
* Quicker process of finding bugs
