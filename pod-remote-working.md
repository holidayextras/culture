## Pod Remote Working - Recommended Practices

### General

#### Video Conferencing (Hangouts/Slack)

* Check meeting room is equipped with good quality camera and microphone.
* Pod members can mute their microphone when not speaking to improve audio quality for other participants.
* Quality of remote network connection can impact video/audio conferencing ability. Try audio only if video is not possible.
* Quality of WiFi connectivity could be impacted in the office or remotely - a wired connection could be used if this is likely to be an issue.


### Focus in group activities
Pod could agree jointly to try to keep focus during group activities when in remote meetings. For example pod members distracted by email/Slack during sprint planning.

### Pair Programming
Positive feedback received from pods when Developers have used the ScreenHero tool. See Pair Programming best practices on Culture Repo for more details.

### Standups
The pod can agree speaking order during daily stand-up to reduce cross-talking. For example team members could agree to speak in alphabetical name order or each member nominates the next speaker.
Could be done verbally via Slack/Hang outs or using chat in a dedicated pod channel.


### Sprint Planning
Estimation could be carried out remotely using video sharing such as Google Hangouts or Slack. Alternatively Google Drawings app, [Realtimeboard](https://realtimeboard.com/)/[Conceptboard](https://conceptboard.com/) can could be used to support JIRA estimations remotely between pod members.
The online [Planitpoker](http://www.planitpoker.com/board/) tool can also be used to assist with estimations.

### Retrospectives
Feedback from pods previously recommended that pod members prepare as much as possible in advance for their retrospectives so that meeting time can be focussed on reviewing rather than brainstorming learnings during the meeting.
