A wash-up can be held after any significant event that has happened where we believe actions can be taken so that we can better improve our performance in the future.  This could be following an expedite issue or at the end of a large project.

A [wash-up meeting template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iYaqVGujJ8ARBgKtFsYxXgswjkdnwxB4flneT6m_9uM/edit) has been created to prepare for the meeting. All information on why the meeting is taking place should be filled in and circulated to all relevant parties in advance.

The wash-up meeting itself should be focused on what we have learned and what we can improve for next time.

For extra guidance on running a wash-up, please check the [Expedite website.](https://sites.google.com/holidayextras.com/hxexpediteprocedure/how-do-i-run-a-wash-up)

After the meeting the facilitator should circulate the notes to the wider team as per the [Expedite website.](https://sites.google.com/holidayextras.com/hxexpediteprocedure/how-do-i-run-a-wash-up) with a summary explaining the key findings and actions. Any actions from the meeting should then be recorded on the [wash-up board on Jira.](https://holidayextras.jira.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=453)

For additional info or any other questions on holding a wash-up please feel free to contact any of the People Leads or Agile Coaches who are happy to help.
