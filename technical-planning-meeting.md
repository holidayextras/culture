# Technical Planning Meetings

## Definition

* A technical planning meeting (TPM) is an informal discussion aimed at streamlining our development processes and agreeing on a technical solution and/ or next steps
* They can be as short or as long as necessary
* They should be requested by engineers

## When is one appropriate?

* When starting a new project
* When adding new features or functionality
* When the technical implementation is not clear for the next iteration of a feature
* When undertaking work that requires multiple teams to collaborate on a technical solution

## Expected Outcomes

* High level documentation of the business problem, the technical solution and/ or next steps and the business impact (at a high level, it should be established how complex the task is in order that we can analyse the business impact)
* Engineers should have a clear understanding of what is expected moving forward
* What the next steps are, this could be a list of actionable tasks
* A definition of done/ acceptance criteria
* Stakeholders should be clear what [Tech Debt](/best-practices/tech-debt.md) there is with any MVP (Minimum Viable Product)


## Probable Attendees

* Engineer(s) with a technical challenge
* Engineer(s) to support the discussion and agree a technical solution/ next steps
* Data engineers (if data needs to be considered)
* Designers or a representative from the UXUI guild (if visual changes may be required)
* Business owners (if the business requirements are sufficiently complex and to assess the business impact)
* Testers (if there is a large testing requirement. If so, ask in #testers)

## The Process

#### Part 1 - Before the TPM

* Make a copy of the [TPM template](https://docs.google.com/a/holidayextras.com/document/d/1zVbOz0dRAnzZ6UhjYO1Ce1YGI2dzvEoYvZfkTK7qjYU/edit?usp=sharing). Part 1 is completed and to increase visibility that the TPM is taking place, notification of the TPM is posted with a link to the document in the Slack Channel #tpm
* Place the TPM in the shared drive.

#### Part 2 - During the TPM

* The engineer explains the business problem they're trying to solve and open it up for discussion
* We exchange thoughts and ideas, fill in any blanks and compromise where necessary to reach a good solution - using the TPM template agenda as a meeting guide
* We break the work down into small chunks
* If the chunks of work are not small enough to begin work, arrange for future TPMs to dig deeper into the larger problems

#### Part 3 - After the TPM

* Following the TPM, the engineer discusses the outcome with the key stakeholders to agree next steps and confirm business impact
* Delivery Managers can then prioritise the work as appropriate
* Once the TPM template has been completed in full, circulate a link with the TL;DR section to relevant groups (e.g. webit email group)
