# Technical Planning Meetings

## Definition

* A technical planning meeting (TPM) is an informal discussion aimed at streamlining our development processes and agreeing on a technical solution and/ or next steps
* They can be as short or as long as necessary
* They should be requested by engineers

## When is one appropriate?

* When starting a new project
* When adding new features or functionality
* When the technical implementation is not clear for the next iteration of a feature
* When undertaking work that requires multiple teams to collaborate on a technical solution

## Expected Outcomes

* High level documentation of the business problem, the technical solution and/ or next steps and the business impact (at a high level, it should be established how complex the task is in order that we can analyse the business impact)
* Engineers should have a clear understanding of what is expected moving forward
* What the next steps are, this could be a set of Jiras for Pod Leads to prioritise 
* A definition of done/ acceptance criteria
* Pod Leads or Stakeholders should be clear what [Tech Debt](https://github.com/holidayextras/culture/blob/master/tech-debt.md) there is with any MVP (Minimum Viable Product)


## Probable Attendees

* Engineer(s) with a technical challenge
* Engineer(s) to support the discussion and agree a technical solution/ next steps
* Database gurus (if data engineer required. If so, ask in #pod-data for a rep)
* UXUI gurus (if frontend work will be required. If so, ask in #pod-uxui for a rep)
* Business owners (if the business requirements are sufficiently complex and to assess the business impact)
* Testers (if there is a large testing requirement. If so, ask in #testers)
* Project gurus (engineers might require additional technical assistance - if INF required, invite Damien Turner and if Multimedia required, invite Jess Everton)

## The Process

##### Part 1 - Before the TPM

* Make a copy of the [TPM template](https://docs.google.com/a/holidayextras.com/document/d/1zVbOz0dRAnzZ6UhjYO1Ce1YGI2dzvEoYvZfkTK7qjYU/edit?usp=sharing). Part 1 is completed and to increase visibility that the TPM is taking place, notification of the TPM is posted with a link to the document in the Slack Channel #tpm
* Place the TPM in the shared drive.

##### Part 2 - During the TPM

* At the TPM, the engineer explains the business problem they're trying to solve and open it up for discussion (if there is no technical proposal, otherwise:)
* The developers explain their technical solution and open it up for discussion
* We exchange thoughts and ideas, fill in any blanks and compromise where necessary to reach a good solution - using the TPM template agenda as a meeting guide
* We break the work down into small chunks
* If the chunks of work are not small enough to begin work, arrange for future TPMs to dig deeper into the problem (an example of when this might be necessary - "We want to start selling Coach")

##### Part 3 - After the TPM

* Following the TPM, the engineer discusses the outcome with the Pod Lead and/ or key stakeholders to agree next steps and confirm business impact
* Pod Leads prioritise the work as appropriate
* Once the TPM template has been completed in full, circulate a link with the TL;DR section to relevant groups (e.g. webit email group)
