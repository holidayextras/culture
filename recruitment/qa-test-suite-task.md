## QA Engineer Task

##### Your task is to create a suite of automated tests against an open API.

We would expect this task to take a few hours, however there is no strict time limit and you won't be judged on how long it took you to complete. We'd like you to write your tests against [the Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and you can use a language of your choice.

Your solution must;

* Test a minimum of 1 of the available endpoints.
* Test a variety of functions within that endpoint.
* Cater for a number of different scenarios.
* Be able to be run within a [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) environment.

Although the main outcomes of the task are listed above, if you feel like you want to go that extra mile and show us what you're capable of, here is a list of potential enhancements that we have come up with;

* Demonstrate the tests running as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
* Document the test plan, defining the outcomes covered.
* An easy to digest report of the tests, for non techies.
* Separate test data (fixtures) to increase ease of maintainability.
* Parallelisation within CI environment.
* Consider how, if the API was local, you would cater for variable external data sources.

Alternatively if you can think of any other features that you feel would further enhance your test suite, then we'd love to see what you can come up with!
