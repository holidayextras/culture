# General Javascript Best Practices

## Purpose of this document

- Make everyone aware of and discourage general antipatterns.
- Make everyone aware of general patterns.
- Provide a point of reference for what good code looks like at Hx.
- Get people writing code in a similar way.

Please also see the respective serverside and clientside best practice docs.

## ECMAScript version support

We use *some* ECMAScript 6 at HX. This is fulfilled by Babel and Node v4 where applicable. We should use these newer es6 features where it makes sense and can improve readability. Please have a look at our technical resources [section on ES6](technical-resources.md#es6) to familiarise yourself with some of the new features available to us. Please see [below](#what-antipatterns-could-i-run-into-with-my-newfound-es6-power) for advice when using some ES6 features. If we come across any new anti-patterns that arise from using ES6 features we should add them to this document.

## Function names should reflect behaviour (as much as possible):
When writing functions, their names should give a good indication of what they do, for example:

**Bad:**

```javascript
// Function name is misleading.
var notifyThingies = function() {
  if (userLoggedIn) {
    trigger("booking_complete");
  }
}

notifyThingies();
```

**Good:**

```javascript
// Check the condition outside the function:
var notifyBookingComplete = function() {
   trigger("booking_complete");
}

if (userLoggedIn) {
  notifyBookingComplete();
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
// Adjusting the function name to accommodate the conditional behaviour:
var notifyBookingCompleteIfAuthenticated = function() {
  if (userLoggedIn) {
    trigger("booking_complete");
  }
}

notifyBookingCompleteIfAuthenticated();
```

**Good:**

```javascript
// With a more complex condition, use an external function:
var userLoggedIn = function() {
  return (user.get('email') && session.get('authenticated'));
}

var notifyBookingComplete = function() {
   trigger("booking_complete");
}

if (userLoggedIn()) {
  notifyBookingComplete();
}

```

You can see above that in the bad example, the `notifyBookingComplete()` function suggests it's going to notify some thingies, but that notification is actually condition. If the programmer weren't to read the code in that function they've have no idea, in essence, the function name doesn't accurately reflect the function.

We avoid this issue in the good examples. Depending on the complexity of the condition in question it might be worth updating the function name, moving the condition out of the function or putting the condition into it's own function. These aid with understanding, readability and testability of code.

**Caveat:** This approach isn't always practical with more complex functions. For example, a function may contain complex conditional logic that can't be succinctly reflected in its name, and that we don't want to inline and repeat everywhere. In this scenario, we can use things like throwing `Errors` or `true`/`false` return values for sync code and rejecting promises & erroring callbacks for async code. The ultimate aim is just to ensure that the programmer isn't mislead about the behaviour of the function, and encourage them to consider handling non-happy path behaviour.


## Functional JavaScript

JavaScript's [first-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function) enable it to support the [functional programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). This is _a good thing_: making your code **more functional** can improve its readability, testability and maintainability.

### Partial (function) application

Consider the following function:

```javascript
function subtract(x, y) {
  return x - y;
}
```

The following are all equivalent ways to implement the `subtractFrom5` and `subtract5` functions using `subtract`:

 * Wrapper functions:

   ```javascript
   var subtractFrom5 = function (x) {
     return subtract(5, x);
   }
   var subtract5 = function (x) {
     return subtract(x, 5);
   }
   ```

 * [Partial application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#Partial_Functions):
   * **ES5 / ES2015**:

     ```javascript
     var subtractFrom5 = subtract.bind(null, 5);
     // `subtract5` impossible using `bind` for partial application
     ```
   * **lodash [`partial`](https://lodash.com/docs#partial) / [`partialRight`](https://lodash.com/docs#partialRight)**:

     ```javascript
     var subtractFrom5 = _.partial(subtract, 5);
     var subtract5 = _.partialRight(subtract, 5);
     ```

The functional alternatives created using partial application are more concise
and _can_ be more readable.


## Preferred libraries

There are many 3rd party libraries to use on [npm.org](http://www.npm.org), but some are better than others. Any library listed below should be used over inferior competing libraries:

### Lodash

Use instead of underscore, due to correct semantic versioning, better performance and some extra features.

Please only require the methods you need rather than the whole library in order to keep build sizes at a minimum.

**Good:**
```javascript
var _ = {
  includes: require('lodash/collection/includes')
};
```

**Bad:**
```javascript
const _ = require('lodash');
```

### grunt-shell

Use instead of grunt-exec, due to a configurable max output buffer size option. Required if running a command with a lot of output.

## What antipatterns could I run into with my newfound ES6 power?

### Auto Destructuring
https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-destructuring

General rule of thumb here is to use this feature as a consumer, not a producer. You shouldn't be required to destructure the result of a function to use it.

The case for destructuring function return values (for example, returning a tuple), can be more of a BAD practice than a good one. Consider this function:
```
function getData() { return [ "oliver", 27 ]; }
```
As a consumer of this function I'll get an array of two values. Without looking at the code, or hunting for documentation, I've got no idea what those data items mean. After some digging I might be able to destructure it like so:
```
var name, age;
[name, age] = getData();
```
and from then on, all future consumers of the original function will have to go through the same process of "what does this data mean?!"

The far better practice, that we currently implement, is whereby we always return a named object:
```
function getData() {
  return {
    name: "oliver"
    age: "27"
  };
}
```
any consumer of this module can very quickly tell what data is coming back, and without looking at the code, just looking at the return value, it's extremely obvious what data they've got.


### Auto Rest parameters + Spread operator
https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-rest-parameters
https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-the-spread-operator

```
// Great use case
render: function(editing) {
    return <SessionHeader {...this._headerProps()} />;
  },

  _headerProps: function() {
    return {
      locales: [window.locale],
      onLogoutClick: this._onLogoutClick.bind(this)
    };
  }
```

Don't use it in node because we are currently always explicit in naming function arguments and reducing the params to each function:
```
var doStuff = function(name, list) { /* ... */ };

var name = "oli";
var list = [ 1, 4, 5, 7, 9 ];
doStuff(name, list);
```

## NPM Modules

When creating an NPM module for others to use (private or open source) it is worth giving consideration to the following points.

### Post install scripts

These are run every time the module is installed by a consuming project which will increase CI and developer build time.

If the module is being released to NPM consider using a `prepublish` script instead.

For internal modules a separate `build` task can be used then the module packed and uploaded as an GitHub asset to accompany releases. For more information please see the [Deployment Guidelines for private NPM releases](deployment-guidelines.md#private-npm-releases)

### Dependencies

#### Version Mismatching

Many of our applications have both internal and external code dependencies and these internal dependencies usually contain a set of their own dependencies. When there are shared dependencies between the parent project and the child, there are occasions when dependencies are updated in one project and not another.

##### Example

A perfect example of this is Lodash. Lodash is used in many of our projects and if versions are not kept in sync then you can see something like this:

When versions are matched:

![Small footprint](/images/dependencies/small.png)

After upgrading the Lodash version within our client application but not it's dependencies:

![Larger footprint](/images/dependencies/large.png)

The total bundle size has increased by 6.3%

When we go to generate the minified JavaScript asset and it finds a version mismatch, it will usually bundle both versions of the package into the released asset, which will impact the size and performance of our applications.

With this in mind, when upgrading/downgrading dependencies in any way then it would be beneficial to check that any applications that are dependent on these libraries have their versions kept in sync.

#### Choosing Third-party Dependencies

In the majority of cases it is a better option to use an existing module that contains the functionality you require rather than implementing it yourself. When choosing modules it's worth evaluating them

* Is the module well maintained? Are the owners receptive to issues and pull requests?
* Is the module unnecessarily bloated?


#### Versioning

When specifying requirements first aim to use the `^` semver match. Only resort to using `~` or pinning the version if there is a known problem the module's versioning strategy.


Also, when choosing a third party module to use, prefer ones with a version number of one or above, this will allow for more lenient semver matching for dependencies and hopefully more reliable version behavior from the module.
